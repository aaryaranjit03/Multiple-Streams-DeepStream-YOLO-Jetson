# Multiple Streams DeepStream YOLO on Jetson

This project demonstrates the implementation of YOLO object detection using NVIDIA's DeepStream SDK on Jetson devices. It processes multiple video streams for real-time object detection and analytics.

---

## Features

- **Multiple Stream Support**: Handles simultaneous processing of multiple video feeds.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Powered by the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model.
- **Optimized for NVIDIA Jetson**: Leverages the DeepStream SDK for efficient GPU acceleration.

## Hardware Used
- NVIDIA Jetson device (e.g., Jetson Nano, Xavier, Orin)
- Camera(s) or video streams for input

---

## Software Used
- NVIDIA JetPack SDK
- NVIDIA DeepStream SDK
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (specified in `requirements.txt`)
